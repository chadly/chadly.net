title: It's Tough Times Out There

"Times are tough" -- I've heard that phrase ten thousand times in the past few months. I am so sick of hearing about the economy and how bad everything is.Â I feel like much of it is a self-fulfilling prophecy -Â  a vicious feedback cycle that is perpetuated by how much everyone talks about it _all-the-freaking-time_.

Anyway, I was pulling into the parking lot at work this morning, and somebody on the radio said something to the effect of "I know times are tough, butâ€¦" and I shut the radio off right there.Â [STFUMF](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stfumf) - is what I thought to myself.Â  Maybe a little harsh, but hey, its my thoughts and I can get as angry as I want in my head.Â I am just desperately tired of hearing about the economy - especially that one phrase - "times are tough".Â Are times really that tough?Â My wife and I have not lived our lives any differently since the start of this recession.Â We still go out to eat, go see movies, and generally do what we want to do. I feel like I have been largely unaffected by this recession. These were my thoughts as I got out my car and headed into work.

At 10:30, I'm walking back to my desk from the bathroom and I happen to pass my boss's office. The HR rep for the company is in there with him.Â "Chad, come see a sec."Â I walk in, they close the door behind me.Â Oh shit, what did I do?

> We've been forced to make budget cuts and I need to cut two salaries from IT.Â I tried to fight it, but they told me who to cut.

Long story short, I ended up getting laid off along with 16 other people today (2 from IT).Â My boss looked like he was getting teary-eyed as he told me the news.Â He made sure to stress it had nothing to do with performance and it was simply because I made too much money.Â I also learned that they are getting rid of the building I work in and consolidating everyone to one building (we had 2 buildings before). Damn, I guess times really are tough.

They gave me a severance package and my wife and I have enough saved up to get us by for a while.Â I also think I will not have too much trouble finding another job (knock on wood). So, I am not sweating it too much.Â That being said, anyone out there have any leads for a .Net developer focusing on Domain-Driven Design and Test-Driven Development?Â ðŸ˜€
