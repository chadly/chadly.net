# Ode to Trogdor

Trogdor was a man. He was a dragon...man. Uh, then he was just a dragon. But he was still TROGDOR! TROGDOR! Burninating the country side. Burninating the peasants. Burninating all da' peoples and their thatched-roof cottages! Thatched-roof cottages! And then Trogdor comes in the NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT!

### How It Works

I made this using After Effects with [Bodymovin and Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie/).

Check out the [After Effects project](https://github.com/chadly/trogdor) on GitHub and see how the [lottie animation files are integrated via React](https://github.com/chadly/chadly.net/blob/master/src/trogdor/index.js) onto this page.
