I worked with a small team of developers to build out the [CivicSource auction platform](https://www.civicsource.com/), a web application which facilitates auctions of delinquent taxes and property online. I came on board very early in the company's history and played a major role in architecting and building the software to its current state.

Some technical challenges I helped overcome involved designing and implementing a scalable messaging infrastructure to split a web application and its database to run across multiple web servers.
