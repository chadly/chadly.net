* Setup source control (Subversion) and a continuous integration server (CruiseControl.Net and later TeamCity) to facilitate an Agile development process.
* Spearheaded Test-Driven Development with the web-based corporate intranet using the Model-View-Controller pattern implemented with Castle Monorail.
