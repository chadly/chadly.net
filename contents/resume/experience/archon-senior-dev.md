I mentored a small team of developers and QA to continue to build out [CivicSource](https://www.civicsource.com/) as a web-based tax collection software to municipalities.

Developing this software has provided many interesting technological challenges:

* Implemented real-time bidding across multiple web servers under a very large traffic load using web sockets to create a highly-responsive and scalable web application.
* Able to work with a very large and growing codebase to implement new technologies ([single-page applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) in a way that keeps legacy systems running but allows new development to use the latest and greatest technologies. We use a number of client-side libraries to help in this process including [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) & [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).
