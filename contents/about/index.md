Hello, gentle internet traveller. I am Chad -- a software developer based out of New Orleans.

I am currently working on creating efficient web frameworks and user experiences at [CivicSource.com](https://www.civicsource.com/careers/). In my spare time, I often contribute to the [open source community](https://github.com/chadly).

If you want to send me a message, you can always use [INTERNET MAIL](mailto:blog@chadly.net). It is a fast new way to communicate without having to use the post office.

Or you could tweet me [@wchadly](https://twitter.com/wchadly) -- you know, like a bird.
