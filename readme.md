# Personal Website

Built with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith).

[Read a full introduction](http://chadly.net/2013/12/automate-all-the-things-with-wercker/) to how this site is built & deployed.

## How to Use

### Running Locally

From the project directory, install dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

Then build the web assets and preview the site:

```
npm start
```

This will spin up a server running at `localhost:8080`. The preview server uses `dev.json` for configuration.

### Building for Deployment

In order to build the site to deploy to a static hosting provider, just run:

```
npm run build
```

and copy the contents of `/build` to your provider. The `dist` task uses `prod.json` to configure the Wintersmith build.
