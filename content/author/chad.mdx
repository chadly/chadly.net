ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Chad. I'm a Tech Lead turned founder, but I mostly see myself as a web developer specializing in the .NET Core, React, and Node.js ecosystems. I like to build tools to make developers' lives easier. I am currently working on a [modern job platform for .NET Core and Node.js](https://www.runly.io/).
