Given a [Disqus XML export](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717164-comments-export), this [source plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/) will make threads & comments available to query via GraphQL. This will allow you to statically render comments and not include the Disqus embed code on your site.

This can be useful if you are trying to migrate away from Disqus but you don't want to lose your existing comments. Or it could be useful if you want to server-render your comments for SEO purposes and replace the comment div with the Disqus embed code at runtime.
