[GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to upload a directory of assets to [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) under a specified version number directory. If the versioned assets have already been uploaded, the upload will be skipped.

This can be useful to automatically deploy versioned web assets from GitHub to an [Azure CDN](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cdn/).
