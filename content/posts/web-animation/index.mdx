**<abbr title="too long;didn't read">tl;dr</abbr>**: I [made a Gatsby Remark plugin](https://github.com/chadly/gatsby-remark-lottie) that makes it easy to drop Lottie JSON animation files into your Markdown/MDX.

</Alert>

Over the past couple of weeks, I've been spending a lot of time in After Effects. We've been working on producing [tutorial videos for Runly](https://www.runly.io/youtube/) and I've taken it upon myself to do the motion graphics for the videos.

I've always [dabbled with video editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP-2ksWFk4o) and [special effects](https://vimeo.com/1524951) in the past, but I've never had an excuse to use it for something real.

I generally don't think of myself as one of the "creatives" but I've been having a lot of fun playing with motion graphics over the past few days. I've even watched three or four tutorial videos on YouTube, so naturally, I'm an expert now. Take a look at part of the intro I made:

## Using After Effects Motion Graphics on the Web

You should go ahead and inspect that animation above. You may be wondering how I was able to render that animation without embedding a video or an animated GIF (or maybe you aren't wondering and you already know -- don't get ahead of me).

Well, my dear internet friend, you can thank [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) and her sister [Bodymovin](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud.details.12557.bodymovin.html) for bringing you that great animation.

When I first read that tweet, I had no idea what she was talking about. I thought these were all made-up words (I mean technically, that is true -- all words are made-up). But, then I started to look into it and I discovered some cool stuff.

Apparently, if one is so inclined, one can make an animation in After Effects, export it to a JSON file (using the Bodymovin plugin), and then render it on the web as an animated SVG (using the Lottie JS package).

It seemed too serendiptious for me to stumble upon this tweet just as I was starting to get into motion graphics with After Effects. The stars just happened to align.

</FlexBox>

Naturally, I immediately started playing with it and coming up with all sorts of reasons to use animated SVGs everywhere. Now that I have a new hammer, everything looks like a nail.

## Performance of CSS Animations vs JS Animations

Before I get into it further, I hear some people in the back grumbling about animated SVGs aleady being a thing without needing to involve any JS scripts.

Well, dear peanut gallery, I implore you to read up on how [JS animations outperform CSS animations](https://css-tricks.com/myth-busting-css-animations-vs-javascript/) written by people doing this web animation thing for longer than me. An animated SVG (without scripts) is using CSS to do its animations.

The gist is that JS animations are more better than CSS-animated SVGs. ðŸ¤·

## Accessibility of Lottie Animations

One thing that started to worry me as I started to put animations in **all the places** was that maybe this wasn't as accessible as I had hoped. Before the Lottie script loads to animate the SVG, the page is rendered with an empty container element:

```html
<div id="myanimation"></div>
```

That kind of sucks. What about the poor search engines who go to index your site and don't know what the hell that `div` is? Or what about the people who browse with JS disabled who will never see anything in that `div` (are there still people who do that in 2020)?

Ideally, I thought, we could follow the principle of graceful degradation and render a static SVG in that `div` for the search engines and the no-JS people. That way they would still have an idea of what was going on there -- it just wouldn't animate.

### Enter Gatsby Plugin

I like using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) due to the way it renders my React components ahead of time so that my site serves static HTML. After the site initially loads, a SPA is loaded on the client side to offer faster navigation and other perks. But, the site can work completely without JS.

Gatsby seems like a perfect fit to create a plugin that can take a Lottie JSON file and render it to a static SVG which is then "enhanced" with animation after the `lottie-web` script loads.

So, that's exactly what I did. I created a [Gatsby Remark plugin](https://github.com/chadly/gatsby-remark-lottie) to allow you to easily drop Lottie JSONs into your Markdown/MDX which then generates "placeholder" SVGs which are animated after the fact.

```markdown
Hi here is a cool animation:

![alt text](myanimation.json)
```

Wow, it's so easy! No need to muck with the `lottie-web` scripts or worry about pre-rendering the JSON files to SVG. The plugin takes care of all of it for you! Wow, again! Much impress!

You can see it in action on this page by disabling javascript and scrolling around looking at the animations. With JS disabled, you should still see the static SVG as a placeholder.

<Alert title="Disable JS in Chrome">

1. `F12` to open dev tools
2. `F1` to open dev tools settings
3. Check _Disable Javascript_
4. Refresh the page
5. Bask in the static SVGs

Won't you hop aboard the web animation rocket with me? There are so many places throughout the web that are dying for your animated touch.

## What's the use case for this?

I think where this web animation stuff really shines is in interaction design. With `lottie-web`, you can make an animation start or stop in response to a user action (e.g. liking something on Twitter). Subtle uses like that can really enhance the overall user experience of your app.

The way I am using animations on this page are more like glorified animated GIFs. I think the use case for this plugin is not in interaction design, but in "statically" showing animations (if that makes sense).

I'm thinking you can use this in a header or somewhere where you want to capture your reader's attention without loading a large video or GIF file. Like, maybe a "summer sale" animation:

<Box>

![summer sale](summer-sale.json)

</Box>

For interaction design, I think you would be better off integrating the lottie-web library directly. This plugin is really just to make it easy to show some animations throughout your site -- less focused on interaction.

Like I said before, I'm new to this whole web animation thing. Let me know what you think on Twitter. [Follow me @wchadly](https://twitter.com/wchadly) while you are there for more content like this.
